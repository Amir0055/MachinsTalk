# MachinTalks
**IoT Simulation Platform with Angular and Spring Boot**

## 📖 Project Description
MachinTalks is a **IoT Based Company** designed solution to facilitate the load testing of APIs using a user-friendly web interface. Built with Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, this project enables users to create and manage performance tests efficiently. The application allows users to define test scenarios, select APIs, and generate comprehensive reports based on the test results.

### 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a streamlined solution for developers and testers to evaluate the performance of their APIs under various load conditions. It is particularly useful for applications in fields like web services, microservices, and any system where API performance is critical.

## 🚀 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface that guides users through the process of creating and managing load tests.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the status of API performance in real-time during tests.
- **Scenario Creation**: Easily define scenarios with multiple APIs, parameters, and performance criteria.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generate reports to analyze the results of each test.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: (Specify if used, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
