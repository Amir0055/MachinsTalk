# MachinTalks

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3 1 & SpringBoot Maven Project.

## Development Performance Test Run Platform
Run Backend Service from  [here](https://github.com/mounakhattat/MachinTalksBackend).
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.


## Steps
1/ Run `ng serve`

2/Create your application information that will help for performance testing afterward. ðŸ˜Š

4/After creating your app and defining some of your APIs, you want to put them under load test. Now, let's go ahead and create a scenario. ðŸ˜Š

## Further help
â€¢ We Used ASM library : to dynamically Generate the Gatling Perf test code in the Backend in real-Time during the waiting process in Step 5/. 
and We Run that automticly after ðŸ˜Š.So that's the reason why the Rapport generated
